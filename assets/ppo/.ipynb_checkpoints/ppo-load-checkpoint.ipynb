As a result, training usually consists of collecting data, optimizing the policy for a single gradient step on that data, then throwing the data away.\n",

However, once we make a gradient step to update our policy, that trajectory is no longer drawn from the distribution of trajectories conditional on our new policy, so we have to throw it away.\n",
